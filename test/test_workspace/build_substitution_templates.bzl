# Description:
#   String variables containing build-file segment substitutes, to be used with the
#   `maven_repository_specification(build_substitutes = {...})` dictionary property.  These have specific documentation
#   on any template variables
#
#   Given the volatility (and lack of automation) of the deps lists in these substitutions, these templates aren't
#   intended for generic usage.  They can be freely cut-and-pasted as given in this example file, but the deps list
#   needs curation.  Indeed, it mostly only has variable substitution because the unversioned coordinates don't change
#   so frequently.

# Description:
#   Substitutes the naive maven_jvm_artifact for com.google.dagger:dagger with a wrapper that
#   exports the compiler plugin.  Contains the `version` substitution variable.
